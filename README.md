Project Recipes from The Odin Project Foundations Course: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

The  assignment asks to build a recipes basic website with an index.html page that has link to recipes. This small project will test my HTML knowledge, but I will also practice working with git and Github.
